    if err != nil {
        log.Fatalf("Failed to create rate limiter: %v", err)
    }
    
    // Worker pool with custom configuration

    mux.HandleFunc("/api/upload", withRateLimit(uploadLimiter, handleUpload))
    
    // Database operations with concurrency limiting

        log.Println("Running scheduled cleanup")
        return nil
    }), 5*time.Minute)
    
    // Start server
    server := &http.Server{Addr: ":8080", Handler: mux}

## Design Principles

- **Developer-First**: Safe constructors, comprehensive error messages, and excellent documentation
- **Production-Ready**: Enterprise-grade error handling, graceful shutdown, and observability
- **Idiomatic Go**: Uses standard Go concurrency primitives (goroutines, channels, context)
- **Performance**: High-performance and low overhead design with extensive benchmarking
- **Modularity**: Loosely coupled packages for selective imports and dependency management
- **Robustness**: Context-aware operations with comprehensive timeout and cancellation support
