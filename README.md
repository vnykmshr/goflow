    sched.SetContextPropagation(true, []interface{}{"trace_id", "user_id"})
    sched.Start()
    defer func() { <-sched.Stop() }()
    
    // Exponential backoff for resilient operations
    resilientTask := workerpool.TaskFunc(func(ctx context.Context) error {
        // Simulate API call that might fail
        if time.Now().UnixNano()%3 == 0 {
            return fmt.Errorf("temporary API error")
        }
        fmt.Printf("API call succeeded for user %v\n", ctx.Value("user_id"))
        return nil
    })
    
    // Schedule with advanced patterns
    sched.ScheduleWithBackoff("api_call", resilientTask, scheduler.BackoffConfig{

## Design Principles

- **Idiomatic Go**: Uses standard Go concurrency primitives (goroutines, channels, context)
- **Simplicity**: Clean APIs that abstract common boilerplate and pitfalls
- **Performance**: High-performance and low overhead design
- **Modularity**: Loosely coupled packages for selective imports
- **Robustness**: Graceful failure handling with context integration
