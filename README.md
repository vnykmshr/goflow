A comprehensive Go library that provides high-level, opinionated, and powerful asynchronous patterns for building robust concurrent applications. Instead of mimicking event-driven, future-based models, goflow provides a set of idiomatic Go primitives that leverage standard concurrency features like goroutines, channels, and the context package.

## Features

### ðŸš¥ Rate Limiting (`pkg/ratelimit`)
- **Token Bucket**: Allows burst traffic with configurable capacity and refill rate
- **Leaky Bucket**: Smooths out bursty traffic for consistent processing rate  
- **Concurrency Limiter**: Controls the number of concurrent goroutines

### âš¡ Task Scheduling (`pkg/scheduling`)
- **Worker Pool**: Reusable goroutine pool with graceful shutdown
- **Scheduler**: Time-based task execution with cron-like functionality
- **Pipeline**: Multi-stage concurrent data pipeline builder

### ðŸŒŠ Streaming & I/O (`pkg/streaming`)
- **Stream API**: High-level data stream operations (filter, map, reduce)
- **Async Writer**: Background buffering for high-volume write operations
- **Backpressure**: Flow control to prevent resource exhaustion

## Quick Start

```bash
go get github.com/vnykmshr/goflow
```

```go
package main

import (
    "context"
    "fmt"
    "github.com/vnykmshr/goflow/pkg/ratelimit/bucket"
    "github.com/vnykmshr/goflow/pkg/scheduling/pool"
)

func main() {
    ctx := context.Background()
    
    // Create a rate limiter (10 tokens, refill at 1/second)
    limiter := bucket.New(10, 1.0)
    
    // Create a worker pool with 5 workers
    workerPool := pool.New(5)
    defer workerPool.Close()
    
    // Rate-limited request processing
    if limiter.Allow(ctx) {
        task := func(ctx context.Context) error {
            fmt.Println("Processing request...")
            return nil
        }
        workerPool.Submit(ctx, task)
    }
}
```

## Design Principles

- **Idiomatic Go**: Uses standard Go concurrency primitives (goroutines, channels, context)
- **Simplicity**: Clean APIs that abstract common boilerplate and pitfalls
- **Performance**: High-performance and low overhead design
- **Modularity**: Loosely coupled packages for selective imports
- **Robustness**: Graceful failure handling with context integration
